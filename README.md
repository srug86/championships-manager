# championships-manager
System that allows people to create and manage football championships. Users can create and customize their own teams and championships and they manage the match results. The system displays the resulting pairings based on match results. Users only can access to championships where they have been invited, and they are able to do more (or less) things depending on the privileges that the championship's admin has granted them.
